# Inequality
This repository contains code for running the simulations on inequality and tax policy reported in PLoS One (2021). 

You find here three JUPYTER notebooks run under JULIA 1.2.0 that show the code used to generate the results. The first set of simulations is for a flat income tax regime (with various parameters). The second set of simulations is for a progressive income tax regime, again with various parameters. The third set of simulations is for a wealth tax, with various parameters. 

The simulations run for a couple of minutes, if you do 100K iterations, and I am planning to upload results in the form of pdf files. Feel free to download the notebooks and run them for yourself. Also, feel free to modify parameters or code to explore this area on you own.

This site is currently still under construction and will be ready by the time the PLOS One paper is published.
